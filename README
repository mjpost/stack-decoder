Use the following procmail setup and rule to have the script called

  HOME=/users/post
  MAILDIR=/users/post/mail
  LOGFILE=/users/post/.maillog
  LOGABSTRACT=all
  FROM=`formail -rt -xTo:`

  :0: f
  * ^Subject: mt-class
  | python /users/post/code/mt-class/stack-decoder/process-mail.py

This will create files in the data/ directory when people send an email
to you with a subject of "mt-class" and a body format that looks like
this:

  0 word
  1 word
  2 word
  ...

where the numbers are indexes and the words are translations of a
source language sentence.  

You can then build the ttable (and language model) used by the
JQuery stack decoder by running

  ./build-ttable.py the sentence you had translated ....

where the argument to build-ttable.py is the sentence you had
translated in the emails that people sent to you.
