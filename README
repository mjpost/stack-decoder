This project implements a word-based stack decoder for purposes of
visualization.  It is written in Javascript and JQuery.

Currently, the source-language sentence is hard-coded.  To change it,
you can look for the line that loads "ttable.js" in stack-decoder.html
and point it to another file.  Two available options are
"ttable-german.js" and "ttable-spanish.js".  From these files, it
should be easy to create other sentences.
