This project implements a word-based decoder for purposes of
visualization.  It is written in Javascript and JQuery.

You can see an online demo at
http://cs.jhu.edu/~post/mt-class/stack-decoder/ .  A new language
model, translation model, and sentence can be added in by changing a
single set of variables internally.
